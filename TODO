TODO list
=========

    * in 'tab_storyboard':

        * should implement scene browser's diffs with a difflib; shots
        scene number varies if user inserts a scene between two other
        in scenario tab;

        * should add character's name recognition in shot text widget,
        as did for scenario text widget;

    * in 'tab_resources':

        * what about datebar overlappings?
