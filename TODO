TODO list
=========

    * Menu "Project > New" exits and restarts app by now => should open
    new instances of a RADXMLWindow (Toplevel windows) instead of a
    RADXMLMainWindow (Tk instance);

    * must review tkRAD lib to make this happen; /!\

    * should optimize code anywhere in tkRAD lib (should plan a new
    v1.6?);

    * RADMainWindow._slot_quit_app() should call a hook method
    self.on_quit_app() derivable by subclasses, called just before
    really quitting app;
