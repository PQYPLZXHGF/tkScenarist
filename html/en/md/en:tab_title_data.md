## <a name="introduction"/>Introduction

This app tab is made of a form and some stats data. It allows setting
up project's title, subtitle and more.

Each form entry is quite optional, but people willing to make
professional documents may certainly fill out all of the form,
entirely.

Some stats data may show up at the bottom of this app tab along with
project's progress status.

Please, note these data are only **estimations**, they do *NOT* reflect
any reality.

You will find more accurate data while
[exporting your project](en_app_topmenu.html#project_export_pdf) into some
PDF&reg; documents.

## <a name="usage"/>Usage

Click on each form entry (white zone) and type any relevant data you
need for your project.

Form entries are **one-line** editing zones: it is *NOT* possible to
use carriage return on them.

Double-clicking on a word will select **this word only**.

Triple-clicking on a word will select **the whole line**.

You may select all text in a form entry either by using `Edit > Select
all` menu option or with `<Ctrl-A>` keyboard shortcut.

Any selection band is likely to be replaced by the next keystroke on
the keyboard.

## <a name="finally"/>Finally

**IMPORTANT**: don't forget to **save your project** regularly, either
with `Project > Save` menu option or with `<Ctrl-S>` keyboard shortcut.
