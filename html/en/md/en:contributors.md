`tkScenarist` still needs creative people to help in:

* **making new story/pitch templates** such as 'love story',
'science-fiction', 'thriller', 'fantastic', 'super heroes', 'fairy
tale', 'knight & magic', etc &ndash; anything you'd like to share with
other people (see
**['Story/pitch&nbsp;templates'](en_tools_pitch_templates.html)**);
* **translating the application** into your locale language (italian,
spanish, portuguese, german, dutch, polska, chinese, etc);
* **translating this wiki documentation** into your locale language
(italian, spanish, portuguese, german, dutch, polska, chinese, etc):
please, **[contact admin team](https://github.com/tarball69/tkScenarist/issues/1)** in order to
become a wiki contributor and start translating as soon as you like;
* **beta-testers**: try out the latest software version and tell about
encountered issues on GitHub's **[bugtracker](https://github.com/tarball69/tkScenarist/issues)** interface.

People willing to improve files from the project are suggested to study
GitHub's official documentation about **[forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)** and **[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)**.

Thank you for trying to help us.
