## Freefullware

What is a freefullware?

A **freefullware** is a new kind of software:

* Free as in Freedom;
* Free of charge (gratis);
* Ad-free (no advertisement at all);
* Donate-free (no 'Donate' button at all);
* 100% virus-free;
* no counterpart at all;
* really absolutely free;

Just get it and enjoy.

That's all, folks!


## Features

At this time, the software supports:

* All project management stays in one and unique project file
(extension: `.scn` or `.zip`, as if you like);

* In case of emergency, it is still possible to simply unzip this
project file and to get each project fragment into a simple text file:
the .zip archive internal structure has been thought this way to help
you mastering your data at any moment, in any case;

* First tab is project's data: title, subtitle, episode number/title,
author, author e-mail and phone (plus some stats info);

* Second tab is a `draft/extra notes` text zone you may need, in order
to keep some good idea along with your pitch/scenario;

* Third tab is the `pitch/concept` text zone where you should write all
the strongest steps of your story;

* If you're looking for inspiration, there is also a menu `Tools >
Story/pitch templates` utility dialog designed to simplify pitch
startups;

* Fourth tab is a great tool named `Characters`, where you can manage
all the characters of your story: name list, character's history log,
characters relations (WIP) and so on;

* You also have a menu `Tools > Name database` utility dialog where you
can search amongst thousands of names coming from all origins (WIP);

* Fifth tab is the `Scenario` text zone, plus some additional features
coming soon (WIP);

* Sixth tab is the `Storyboard` panel, still in development (WIP);

* Seventh tab is the `Resources` panel, still in development (WIP);

Notice: **WIP** means **Work In Progress**, that is, in fact, meaning
still in development state.

## Quick start

### Caution

This software runs only with **Python3** and **Tkinter** installed
on your machine.

**No dependencies**, no third-part lib to install on more.

If you have Python3 correctly installed, Tkinter library should also
be installed **by default** as a Python standard lib.

Any **ImportError** will mean either you are trying to launch the
software with Python2 or you don't have **Tkinter** library correctly
installed on your system.

Installing a Python3 version of the language **does not alter** an
already installed Python2 version in any way.

You may consider installing Python3 from:

https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Ctrl+click: open in new tab)

### MS-Windows&trade; users

Simply double-click on `tkscenarist.py` file to launch app.

### UNIX/Linux

Click on `tkscenarist.py` file if it has the executable sticky bit on
or open a shell console and launch file:

    $ python3 tkscenarist.py

That's all, folks!

Enjoy!
